likely and rigorous analysis necessary PGP solves four issues that are key to reform 1 Give data to people who need it In many states granular geographic election data is difficult to acquire or use to draw or analyze maps We are building datasets and resources that allow anyone to access this data before redistricting in 2020 and 2021 2 Use technology to empower citizens during redistricting
