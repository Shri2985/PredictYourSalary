    <div id="rendered-md"><h1 id="does-your-skillset-match-up-with-current-available-jobs">Does Your Skillset Match Up With Current Available Jobs?</h1>
      <p>To see if we have the skills employers are looking for in the data science world, we decided to look from the employer's point of view by analyzing the data science jobs available on <a data-from-md  title='http://indeed.com' href='http://indeed.com' type=''>indeed.com</a>. In this approach, we scraped job descriptions (Beautiful Soup) for all data science jobs available on <a data-from-md  title='http://indeed.com' href='http://indeed.com' type=''>indeed.com</a>.  We processed those job desciptions through a TSNE Visualizer in order to identify evident clusters within the dataset and ran a TF-IDF Vectorizer to see the most common words used in each cluster.</p>
      <p>The same analysis was performed on all available data science jobs in New York City and New Jersey</p>
      <h2 id="web-scraping-and-data-retrieval">Web Scraping and Data Retrieval</h2>
      <p>First, in order to ignore fuzzy matches from our job searches, we only focused on jobs that had the following word phrases in its job title:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>data scientist</li>
      <li>quantitative analyst</li>
      <li>statistician</li>
      <li>data analyst</li>
      <li>research scientist</li>
      <li>machine learning engineer</li>
      <li>data engineer</li>
      </ol>
      <p>3013 Job Postings matched this criteria regardless of location. (NYC - 539, NJ - 102)</p>
      <h2 id="pre-processing-job-description-data">Pre-processing Job Description Data</h2>
      <p>Job Descriptions were then scraped from those matches. These job descriptions were then preprocessed by removing any unneccasary characters and stop words.</p>
      <h2 id="tsne-visualizer">TSNE Visualizer</h2>
      <p>The Job Descriptions were then run through a TSNE Visualizer in order to identify the amount of clusters in the data.</p>
      <p><img src="../static/images/nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed.png" alt="nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed.png"></p>
      <p>Our inital assumption would be 7 clusters that match the initial Job Class Clusters.  Even though Job Class played significance in certain clusters, one main cluster clearly did not emphasize that significance. After heavy squinting, there are 23 clusters.</p>
      <h4 id="new-york-city">New York City</h4>
      <p><img src="../static/images/nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed-nyc.png" alt="nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed-nyc.png"></p>
      <p>In New York,  the situation differs in that there clearly 9 clusters in the processed job descriptions.</p>
      <h4 id="new-jersey">New Jersey</h4>
      <p><img src="../static/images/nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed-nj.png" alt="nlp-tsne-visualizer-indeed-nj.png"></p>
      <p>As per diagram, it would be difficult to identify any key clusters in the NJ dataset.</p>
      <h2 id="creating-cluster-wordclouds-with-ntlk">Creating Cluster WordClouds with ntlk</h2>
      <p>All job descriptions were then loaded into a TD-IDF Vectorizer and WordClouds were generated for each cluster. We will attempt to write a job summary based off most of the words.</p>
      <p><a data-from-md  title='http://indeed.com' href='http://indeed.com' type=''>indeed.com</a> WordClouds for All Locations<br>
      <a data-from-md  title='http://indeed.com' href='http://indeed.com' type=''>indeed.com</a> WordClouds for NYC and NJ</p>
      <h2 id="generating-a-job-summary-from-all-job-description">Generating a Job Summary from All Job Description</h2>
      <p>For amusement, we will attempt to create a job summary utilizing all the job descriptions from the dataset. We will use ntlk to tokenize the data by applying the CountVectorizer (one-hot encoding) and TF-IDF transformer (adding weights to the encoding).  We can than fit the data into a PCA (Principal Component Anlysis) model in an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of the data.</p>
      <p><img src="../static/images/pca-joint.png" alt="pca-joint.png"></p>
      <p>in order to garher semantic meaning of the words, we will apply a soft cosine matrix.</p>
      <p><img src="../static/images/pca-cosine-matrix.png" alt="pca-cosine-matrix.png"></p>
      <p>Based off the diagram, we can define the rectangle of our search for what to use in creating its job summary.</p>
      <p>So to summarize all the data scientist positions on <a data-from-md  title='http://indeed.com' href='http://indeed.com' type=''>indeed.com</a>:</p>
