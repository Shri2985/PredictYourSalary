# PredictYourSalary

As experts awaiting our certification in Data Science, our group has acquired the knowledge, tools, and principles necessary to become employable data scientists in the business realm.  With our newly acquired data science skills, we are on a mission to see if the skills we obtained through the Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp are sufficient for finding an employer and understanding the salary we should expect to receive with our skillset.  We first utilized survey information from members of the data science industry to understand the skills and tools they use in a work environment to understand the value range of such skills and attributes.  We also looked into job descriptions from Indeed for all data science related roles in order to compare the skills data scientists have to the skills employers are looking for.

We hope to understand what skills are valuable in obtaining an job in data science in the salary range we desire.  We also hope to examine the Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp in order to see if there are any skills that need less or more concentration.  Finally, we hope to employers improve job descriptions to help find the type of people they truly desire.
